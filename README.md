# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job  market,
I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** Used for querying and managing the datasets, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- **PostgreSQL:** Utilized as the database management system to store, organize, and analyze large datasets.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Provided a powerful and flexible development environment for writing and debugging code.
- **Git & GitHub:** Facilitated version control and collaborative work, enabling seamless tracking of changes and contributions.

# The Analysis 
 Each query for this project aimed at investing specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
 Here's how I approached each question:

    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date::date
FROM  
    job_postings_fact jpf
JOIN
    company_dim cd
ON jpf.company_id=cd.company_id
where 
    salary_year_avg is not null
